 To create this scatter plot, we're going to use our GG plot function. And we're going to pass it the Mitchell data frame. We'll pass our month variable to x and our temperature variable to y and we'll wrap that in the AES wrapper. And the last thing I'll do is add GM point so that way we create a scatter plot. And there it is. If you use a q plot syntax, it would have been a little bit shorter. And we still get the same plot. Again, q plot is pretty smart here since it automatically knows that x is the month variable and y is the temperature variable. These variables are passed in alphabetically to the parameters X, and then Y. Because both X and Y are used, Q [INAUDIBLE] is to make a scatter [UNKNOWN].
