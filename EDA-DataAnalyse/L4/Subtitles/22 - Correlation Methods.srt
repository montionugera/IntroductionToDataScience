 The Pearson product-moment correlation measures the strength of relationship between any two variables, but there can be lots of other types of relationships. Even other ones that are monotonic, either increasing or decreasing. So we also have measures of monotonic relationships, such as a rank correlation measures like Spearman. We can assign Spearman to the method parameter and calculate the correlation that way. Here we have a different test statistic called row, and notice how our value is slightly different as well. You can learn more about the assumptions and uses of the different methods in the instructor notes. From these last couple correlation videos, the main point I want to make here is that single number coefficients like this are useful, but they are not a grid substitute for looking at a scatter plot and computing conditional summaries like we did earlier. We have a richer understanding by looking at such plots like this one for friend_count and age.
