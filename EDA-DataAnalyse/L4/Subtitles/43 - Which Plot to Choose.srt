 So, we've been looking at lots of different plots of the same data, and talking about some of the trade-offs that are involved in data visualization. So, which plot should you choose? One important answer is that you don't have to choose. In exploratory data analysis, we'll often create multiple visualizations and summaries of the same data, gleaning different incites from each. So, through out the course, as we iteratively refine a particular plot of the same data, it's not that the later versions are always better than the previous versions. Sometimes they are. But, sometimes they're just revealing different things about the same data. Now, when it comes time to share your work with a larger audience, you may need to choose one or two visualizations that best communicate, the main findings of your work.
