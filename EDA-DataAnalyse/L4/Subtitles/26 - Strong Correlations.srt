 To determine the correlation coefficient, we're just going to run our cor.test function. We'll pass at our two variables, www likes received, and likes received. This gives us a correlation of .948. This is a strong positive correlation, and in reality most variables are not correlated that closely. The correlation that we just found was an artifact of the nature of the variables. One of them was really a super set of the other.
