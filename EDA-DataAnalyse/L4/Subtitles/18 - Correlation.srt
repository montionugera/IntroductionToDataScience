 Thinks Mora. Let's get back to our scatter plot of friend count versus age. It might be appealing to further summarize the relationship of age and friend count. Rather than having the four extra layers of geom line, we could try to summarize the strength of this relationship in a single number. Often, analyst will use a correlation coefficient to summarize this, now, if you're not familiar with correlation, you should review the links in the instructor notes. We've even included some practice from Stat 95, that's our statistics course. We're going to use the Pearson product moment correlation, noted with a lower case r, to measure the linear relationship between age and friend count What I want you to do is to look up the documentation for the core.test function. Figure out how to find Pearson's r using any two variables. What's the correlation between age and friend count? Round your answer to three decimal places.
