 While there might not appear to be a correlation between the two variables, let's think about this a little bit more. What's on the x-axis? Months. And what's on the y-axis? Temperature. So, we know that this month variable is very discreet. We'll have the months from January to December, and they'll repeat over and over again. Let's be sure we add that detail to our plot. Here's the code that we used to create the plot using the ggplot syntax. What layer and syntax would you add to this plot in order to make that change? Type in your code here. You'll want to break open the x-axis every 12 months, so that way it corresponds to a year. I'll let you figure out what the lower and upper limits of the x axis should be. So, what do you think? What layer and syntax should we add?
