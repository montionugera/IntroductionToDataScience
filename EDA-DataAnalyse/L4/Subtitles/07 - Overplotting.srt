 With this new plot, we can see that the friend counts for young users aren't nearly as high as they looked before. The bulk of young users really have friend counts below 1000. That's why we see these really dark regions along here. Remember, alpha is set to 0.05, so it takes 20 points for a circle to appear completely dark. You also still might have seen this peak around 69, which is what we originally saw when we looked at friend count in our data. It's faint because we have the alpha parameter set to 0.05, but I would say that this is comparable to users in say, the 25 or 26 age group.
