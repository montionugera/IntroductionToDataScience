 Now, let's make some more adjustments to our plot. This time we're going to use a transformation on the y-axis, so we change the friend count. We're going to do this so that we can get a better visualization of the data. Let's see if you can figure this out on your own. I want you to look at the documentation for core trans and add it as a layer to this plot. The function you're going to use to transform friend count will be the square root function. See if you can make the plot and think about any observations you have, once you've made it. Now here again is an instance where we haven't given you all the knowledge upfront, but I think you can figure this one out.
