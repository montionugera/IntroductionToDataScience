 For this question, you need to add a layer to this plot to make the months be discrete. To do this, we can add our scale_x_discrete layer. We're going to pass it the parameter breaks, and set the breaks from zero to 203. Now I'm going to step every 12 months. Since 12 months is a year. And you might be wondering how I decided upon 203. If I type in range mitchell month I can see. The range of the month variable and it runs from zero to 203. So this is my lower limit. And my upper limit. We can run this code and we'd get a little bit of a better plot with our months in discrete units.
