 Now you may notice that some of these points are spread out from one another, while others are stacked right on top of each other. This area of the graph is considered to be over plotted. Over plotting makes it difficult to tell how many points are in each region. So we can set the transparency of the points using the alpha parameter and geom point. I'm going to add this on a new line so that we can see our layers more clearly. Next I set the alpha parameter equal to 1 over 20. So this means it's going to take 20 points to be the equivalent of one of these black dots. Writing this code, we can see that the bulk of our data lies below the 1000 threshold for friend count. Now let's also add a little jitter here too. We can swap out geom_point with the geom_jitter. Age is a continuous variable but you really only have integer values, so we are seeing these perfectly lined up columns. Which isn't a true reflection of age. These columns should feel intuitively wrong and we want to make sure that we can see more of the points. So using jitter we can add some noise to each age so we get a clearer picture of the relationship between age and friend count. Writing our code with geom_jitter we can see that we get a more disperse distribution. What stands out to you in this new plot? Keep in mind that the alpha is set to 120th or 0.05.
