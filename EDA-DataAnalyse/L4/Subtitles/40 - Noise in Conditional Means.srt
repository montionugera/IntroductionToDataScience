 This is great. We've got our data frame, with our conditional means measured in months. Now it's just time to plot them. Your final programming task here is to make the plot of mean friend count versus age measured in months. Be sure that you use a line to connect all the points. Just like we did in this plot. Now I'm going to make this a little bit harder. I want you to subset the data frame as well. I want you to only investigate users, with ages less than 71. The plot that you create won't be automatically graded so I encourage you to check out what we did in the solution video.
