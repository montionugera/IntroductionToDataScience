 So after plotting histograms and looking at peoples guesses about their audience size, I wanted to see how that matched up with there actual audience size. So then at that point I turned to scatter plots. So here's an example of the first scatter plots that we did looking at this. So on the x axis is how many people actually saw that post. And on the Y axis is how many people our survey respondents guessed saw the post. If they guessed perfectly accurately, their guess would fall along this dotted diagonal line. That's the perfect accuracy line. But one of the things that stands out with, in the scatter plot, is that you see these horizontal stripes. That's again because people are guessing these regular numbers. You see a really clear stripe at about 50 and another really clear stripe at a hundred, and a little bit of a stripe at 200. And you really see that these all of this, the points on the scatter plot are just this big cluster at the bottom. So people are guessing very small numbers. 20, 50, something like that, when in reality their audience size is 100 or 200.
