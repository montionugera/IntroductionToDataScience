 We need an expression here in order to subset our data frame. So really I'll just run the subset command on our pf data frame or pseudo-Facebook users and I'll take ages that are less than 70. Now the question said 70 or less so I should really use less than or equals here. Running this code we get a very different summary statistic. In fact, this tells a different story about a negative relationship between age and friend count. As age increases, we can see that friend count decreases. It's important to note that one variable doesn't cause the other. For example, it'd be unwise to say that growing old means that you have fewer internet friends. We'd really need to have data from experimental research and make use of inferential statistics. Rather than descriptive statistics to address causality. You may have noticed that I left off the method parameter from cor.test. And that's because cor.test defaults to using the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation. No matter what we do. Adding this in as a parameter, we should get the same result. And running this code, sure enough, I do.
