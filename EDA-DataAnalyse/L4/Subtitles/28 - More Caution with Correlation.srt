 As Moore put it out, correlation can help us decide which variables are related. But even correlation coefficients can be deceptive if you're not careful. Plotting your data is the best way to help you understand it and it can lead you to key insights. Let's consider another data set that comes with the alr3 package. You'll need to install this package first and then make sure you load it. The data set that we're going to load is called the Mitchell Data Set. The Mitchell Data Set contains soil temperatures from Mitchell, Nebraska. And they were collected by Kenneth G Hubbard from 1976 to 1992. By working with this data set, we'll see how correlation can be somewhat deceptive. So, for your first task, I want you to create a scatter plot of temperature versus months.
