 Based on the correlation coefficient in this plot, we just observed that the relationship between age and friend count is not linear. It isn't monotonic, either increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, based on the plot, we know that we maybe don't want to include the older ages in our correlation number. Since older ages are likely to be incorrect. Let's re-calculate the same correlation coefficient that we had earlier with users who are ostensibly age 70 or less. What Cmd would you use to subset our data frame so that way we can get a correlation coefficient for just this data?
