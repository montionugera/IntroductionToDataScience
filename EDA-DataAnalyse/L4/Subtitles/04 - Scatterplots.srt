 Here are some of the things that I noticed. It looks like younger users have a lot of friends. These young users seem to have thousands of more friends than most users over the age of 30. You also might have noticed that there are some vertical bars where people have lied about their age, like 69 and also about 100. Those users are also likely to be teenagers, or perhaps fake accounts, given these really high friend counts. If there's something else that you noticed that we didn't cover, share it in the discussions.
