 To create this plot, we're going to use our gg plot function.We'll pass it www likes received to the x variable, and we'll pass likes received to the y variable. Then we'll set our data frame equal to our pseudo Facebook users and then we'll tell gg plot that we want that we want a gm point or scatterplot. Now I actually forgotten something to do here, I need to wrap my x and y variables inside the aesthetic wrapper. So I'll add that in. Now you might not have used the gg plot syntax, but I highly encourage you to continue to use it and to get practice with it throughout this lesson. We'll be making more use of the gg plot syntax in the next lesson, so it's important that you really know it backwards and forwards. Try making some other scatter plots with different variables to get more familiar with the syntax.
