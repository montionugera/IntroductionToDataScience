 Now that we've got a scatter plot. I want you to take a guess as to what you think the correlation coefficient is, between these two variables. Write that answer in this box. After you've made your guess, I want you to calculate the actual correlation between the two variables and put that number here. Be sure you round your answer to the thousandths place or to three decimal places.
