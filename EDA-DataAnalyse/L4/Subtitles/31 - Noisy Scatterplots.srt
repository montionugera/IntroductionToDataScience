 Now, if I was looking at the scatter file, I would say that the correlation between these two variables is about zero. Now, the autograder would have accepted anything between negative 2 10ths and positive 2/10. We just wanted something reasonable. Now, to actually calculate the correlation, we'd run cor.test function on Mitchell Month in Mitchell Temp. It turns out that the actual value is 57000ths, seems like a pretty weak correlation to me.
