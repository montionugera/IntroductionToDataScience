 For this exercise, you need to create a similar scatter plot that had friend count mean against age with months. We'll use ggplot to create our figure. I'll pass age with months to x, and I'll pass friend count mean to y. And then I just need to remember to wrap this in AES. Now comes the data frame. I need to be careful that I don't use pseudo Facebook users, since I really want this data frame that we just created. Now that I've got my data frame, I need to subset it. I'll only take the users whose age with months is less then 71. Then, I'll tell ggplot what type of geom I want, in this case geom live. So here's our much nosier plot, a friend count mean versus age with months.
