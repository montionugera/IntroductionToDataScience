 Now that you've seen alpha and jitter in action I'd like you to use your new knowledge of them to explore the relationship between friends initiated and age. Build your plot up in layers and be sure to use the g g plot syntax. I really recommend playing around with this in our studio, and then once you've got your finalized plot, copy and paste your code into the browser and submit it. There's no right or wrong answer here and there's a couple of different ways to make the plot. So just be sure that once you have your final plot, you copy and paste all of your code into the browser and submit. After you've created your plot, share any of your findings in the discussions.
