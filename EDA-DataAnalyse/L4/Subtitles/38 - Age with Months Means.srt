 We're on our way to plotting the conditional means for a to months. Remember we're trying to generate this plot again but only for smaller bin widths. We'll have more data points since age will be measured in months rather than in years. Now that we've got our age with months variable from before we can go ahead and use the d apply r functions. To get a new data frame with an average friend count. And the median friend count for each age with months. So here comes your second programming task. Create a new data frame called PF.FC by age months that contains the mean friend count, the median friend count, and the number of users in each group of age with months. There will be detailed instructions on this on the next page. And an example of what your output should look like. Now this is one of the more challenging programming exercises. So if you get stuck, check out the instructor notes for two hints. This exercise will also be automatically graded and will check the output of your data frame.
