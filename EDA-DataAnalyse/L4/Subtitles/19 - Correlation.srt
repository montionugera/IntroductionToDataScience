 To look at the documentation, you'll simply type in ?cor.test. That will bring up this page. It looks like cor.test takes two vectors x and y. And then it will compute the correlation coefficient. It looks like we have a couple methods for determining that coefficient and we could either use pearson, kendall or spearman. For our purposes, we'll be using the pearson method. So your code might have looked like this. Writing this code, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.0274. This indicates that there's no meaningful relationship between the two variables. A good rule of thumb is that a correlation greater than 0.3 or less than minus 0.3, is meaningful, but small. Around 0.5 is moderate and 0.7 or greater is pretty large. Another way to compute the same coefficient is to use this code. Here, I'm using the width function for around the data frame. The width function let's us evaluate an R expression in an environment constructed from the data. Now, I know I haven't shown you this function yet but I wanted to introduce it to you. Running this bit of code we see that we get the same result.
