 Looking at this plot, we can see that we have some funky outliers in here. And down here is the bulk of our data. To determine good x and y limits for our axis, we can look at 95th percentile, using the Quantile command. This will let us see the ninety-fifth percentile of www_likes_received. And the ninety-fifth percentile of likes received. And hopefully, we should get rid of some of these points. To do that, I'll use the x lim layer and the y lim layer. We'll pass zero as the lower bound for x lim, and for the upper limit, we'll use the ninety-fifth percent quantile for the ww likes received. Similarly, for likes received, we'll use the same sort of syntax and just replace the variable. Zero will be our lower bound, and the ninety fifth percentile for likes received will be our upper bound. When I run this code, we're in effect zooming in on that lower portion of the graph that we had over here. The slope of the line of best fit through these points is the correlation. And, we can even add to the plot by using some code. We do that by adding a smoother, and setting the method to a linear model or lm. Notice too that I also colored it red so that we could see it through the black points. Let's quantify this relationship with a number. So what's the correlation between our two variables? I don't want you to have to subset the data, so just include all the data points and then round your answer to three decimal places.
