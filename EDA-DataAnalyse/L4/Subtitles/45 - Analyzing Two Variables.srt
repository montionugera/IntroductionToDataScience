 >> Congratulations on finishing Lesson four. In this lesson, we learned how to explore the relationship between two variables. Our main visualization tool, was the scatter plot. But we also augmented the scatter plot, with conditional summaries, like means. >> We also learned about the benefits and the limitations of using correlation. To understand the relationship between two variables and how correlation may effect your decisions over which variables to include in your final models. >> As usual, another important part of this lesson was learning how to make sense of data through adjusting our visualizations. We learned not to necessarily trust our interpretation of initial scatter plots like with the seasonal temperature data. And we learned how to use jitter and transparency to reduce over plotting. >> We'd love to hear your thoughts in the discussion forum and we hope you learned a lot. Next, we'll move onto lesson five, where we talk about multivariate analysis.
