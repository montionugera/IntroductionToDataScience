Question : 
What's skill that we lack of?
Which way that we need to do to make the better team?
What kind of person that we should hire?
Does pay rate competitive or excessive?

```{r}
setwd("/Users/montionugera/WorkSpace/Udemy-Datascience/IntroductionToDataScience/EDA-DataAnalyse/L4/hr_files")
getwd()
file_list <- list.files()

library(ggplot2)

strong_skill_data <- 
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
