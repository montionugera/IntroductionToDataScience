 The results yield an expected value for price given the characteristics of our diamond, and the upper and lower bounds of a 95% confidence level. Note, because this is a linear model, predict is just multiplying each model coefficient by each value in our data. It turns out that this diamond is a touch pricier than the expected value under the full model, though it is by no means outside of the 95% confidence interval. Blue now has by most accounts a better reputation than diamond SE.info however. And reputation is worth a lot in a business that relies on easy to forge certificates in which the non-expert can be easily fooled. So, while this model might give you a sense of whether your diamond is a ripoff against diamondSE.info diamonds, it's not clear that diamondSE.info should be regarded as the universal source of truth over whether the price of a diamond is reasonable. Nonetheless, to have the expected price and diamondassay.info with a 95% interval, is a lot more information than we had about the price we should be willing to pay for a diamond before we started this exercise.
