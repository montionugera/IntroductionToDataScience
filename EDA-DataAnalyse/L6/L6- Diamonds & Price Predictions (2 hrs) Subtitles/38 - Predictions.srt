 After all this work, let's use our model to make a prediction. We need to exponentiate the result of our model. Since we took the log of price. Let's take a look at an example from Blue Nile. We'll use the full model m5, to predict the value of the diamond. Try to understand what this code does. If you see something you don't understand, look it up in the documentation, then answer the question. Evaluate how well the model predicts the Blue Nile diamond price. Think about the fitted point estimate. As well as, the lower and upper bound of the 95% confidence interval.
