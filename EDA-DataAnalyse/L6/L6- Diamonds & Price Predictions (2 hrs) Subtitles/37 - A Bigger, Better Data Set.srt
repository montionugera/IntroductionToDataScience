 What we will do first is make a variable called logged price, the log of diamond price. And then we will build our model similarly to the way that we did for the small diamond status set. Notice that we're setting price by diamonds who's price is less than $10,000 and who's certificate is G.I.A.. Thankfully our models look quite a bit like they did for the smaller diamond status set. Although our r squared values are just a touch weaker.
