 Thankfully, I was able to put together a Python script to get the current diamond price data, similar to the original diamonds data set, from diamondse.info without too much trouble. This data set is about ten times the size of the 2008 diamonds data set, and features diamonds from all over the world certified by an array of authorities, besides just the General Logical Institute Of America, or the GIA. You can read in this data set as follows, but make sure you've installed the R curl and bit tops libraries before you do. This might take a while as a data set contains over about 500,000 cases. The code used to obtain the data is available at this link. Let's fit the model again to the big data set. We'll only use GIA certified diamonds in this log. I look only at diamonds under $10,000 because these are the type of diamonds sold at most retailers, and hence, the kind we care most about. By trimming the most expensive diamonds from the data set, our model will also be less likely to be thrown off by outliers, and the higher variants at the high-end of price and carat.
