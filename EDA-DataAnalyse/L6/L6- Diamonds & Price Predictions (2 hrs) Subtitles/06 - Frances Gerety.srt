 So far, we've only considered the bivariant relationship between price and carat weight. But there's much more to this data set and I'd like to give it a proper introduction. The diamonds data set ships with ggplot2 and contains the prices and the specs for more than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Now, analyzing this data is particularly useful. Because diamonds are unique in a way that just isn't true of most manufacture products that we're used to buying. You can't just plug in the model number and just look up the price. Though the diamonds data set is full of prices and fairly esoteric certification ratings. Hidden in the data are reflections of how a legendary marketing campaign permeated and was subsumed by our culture. Hints about how different social strata responded and how the diamond market functions today as a result. The story starts in 1870. When many tons of diamonds were discovered in South Africa near the Orange River. Until then the diamond market had been small, only a few pounds of diamonds were mined each year from India and Brazil. At the time, there was no use for diamonds outside of jewelry, so price depended only on scarce supply. Hence, the project's investors formed the De Beers Cartel in 1888, to try to control the global price of diamonds. By most accounts, this has been the most successful cartel in history. But World War I and the Great Depression saw diamond sales plummet. In 1938, the De Beers Cartel contacted Philadelphia ad agency N.W. Ayer and Son to inquire whether, quote, The use of propaganda in various forms Might help jump start diamond sales in the U.S.. Which looked like the only potentially viable market for diamonds at the time. Surveys showed, however, that among couples contemplating marriage, diamonds were low on the list of priorities. A luxury for the rich, money down the drain. Frances Gerety took on the DeBeers account at N.W. Ayer and Son. And work towards the company's goal to quote, create a situation in which every couple contemplating marriage feels the need to acquire a diamond engagement rings. A few years later, she would coin a famous slogan.
