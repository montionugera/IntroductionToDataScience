 Indeed we can see that the prices for diamonds are pretty heavily skewed, but when you put those prices on a log ten scale, they seem much better behaved. They're much closer to the bell curve of a normal distribution. We can even see a little bit of evidence of bimodality on this log ten scale. Which is consistent with our two class rich buyer poor buyer speculation about the nature of customers for diamonds. You actually saw a sneak peek of this in problem set set three when you looked at the log ten of price by cut.
