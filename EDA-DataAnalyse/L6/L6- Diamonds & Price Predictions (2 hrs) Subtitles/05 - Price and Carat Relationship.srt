 When we look at the plot, a few things pop out right away. We can see a nonlinear relationship. Maybe it's exponential or maybe it's something else. We can see that the dispersion or variance of the relationship also increases as carat size increases. With just a quick look at the data we've learned two important things about the functional relationship between price and carat size. We can add a linear trim line to the plot by using the stat smooth function with method equals lm. We can see that the linear trend line doesn't go through the center of the data at some key places. It misses it here. It should curve a little bit in the center of the relationship, and it should slope up more toward the end. And if we tried to use this to make predictions, we might be off for some key places inside and outside of the existing data that we have displayed.
