 On the demand side, customers in the market for a less expensive, smaller diamond are probably more sensitive to price than more well-to-do buyers. Many less than one carat customers would surely never buy a diamond. Diamond were not for the social norm of presenting one when proposing. And there are fewer customers who can afford a bigger diamond that is one that is larger than than one carat, hence we shouldn't expect the market for bigger diamonds to be as competitive as the one for smaller diamonds. So it makes sense that the variants As well as the price would increase with carat size. Now often the distribution of any monetary variable like dollars will be highly skewed and vary over orders of magnitude. Now this can result from path dependence for example the rich getting richer, or multiplicative processes like year on year inflation, or some combination of both. Hence it's a good idea to look into compressing any such variable by putting it on a log scale. For more tips on when to use the log scale and how to transform your variables check out the link in the instructor notes. Let's examine the distribution of price again. In this next programming exercise you complete the code to generate two price histograms.
