 Here, I made four changes to the code. I replaced cut with color in the aesthetic wrapper. I also changed the legend title and the plot title, to use the word color. And finally, I removed the reverse parameter in the legend, so that the best color would be at the top of the list in the legend. Now that we've run our code, this is the output.
