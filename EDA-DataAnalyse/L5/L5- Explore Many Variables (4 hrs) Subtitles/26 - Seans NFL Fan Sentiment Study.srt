You learned about the biasâ€“variance tradeoff in this lesson and
the last lesson. Now I want you to hear from Sean.
Hear about his work at Facebook and pay careful attention to
his models and the trade offs in the visualizations he made.
>> Some recent work I've been doing on measuring fan sentiment for 
NFL teams over the course of the season that I'm really excited about.
it's, it's been a really fun project because I myself am, am an
NF, NFL fan. I'm a huge Eagles fan and I go through all
of the, emotions that a fan goes through over the course of
the season. You know, the highs of when your team wins and then
the lows after a couple losses in a row of feeling kind of
hopeless. And so I got the idea of maybe we could measure this
and kind of tell a story. Not just for my team but
for all the other teams in the NFL, and come up with some
idea, some way of visualizing this, this experience of being a fan. And
so I, I counted ratios of positive to negative words at five-minute increments
over the course of the whole four months of the NFL season. And
because we're taking a ratio, we end up with some measurements that are
extremely high. Like, you know, positive to negative word ratios, oh, over a
hundred even though the average in somewhere in the two to three range.
So this, this was kind of like a first cut at the data, and
we can see that there's some signal here. But it's, it's definitely going to
need some, some modeling or some statistics in order to kind of tease
out what's actually happening. So what I did was just compute a moving average
of these five minute measurements and we start to get a little
bit of signal out of there. Because we're pooling over more measurements, so
the measurements themselves are more reliable. And we end up with a series
that kind of tells a little bit of a story. But these measurements
are still too frequent and too noisy to, to really tell a story
about what's happening. When we aggregate it up to one day moving averages,
we start to see some patterns emerge. I guess one of the key
features of this dataset was that I knew what I was looking for
ahead of time. Because I, I am an Eagles
fan, I experienced the highs and lows of the seasons.
I can look at a plot like this immediately
and tell you this is not telling the story that
I want. We needed to maybe apply some modeling
to that. We want a model that predicts sentiment as
a function of time. And one of the things
that comes to mind right away is a natural spline.
>> You can see that this actually tells a nice story. These color lines are
the dates of wins and loses. It kind of gives you an idea of why
the lines are upward sloping or downward sloping. So you can see
here, kind of like the exuberance at the beginning of the season as
people are really optimistic. And then, you know, three losses in a
row and see how the sentiment dips. This tells a nice story, but
it doesn't have the feature of, that we'd expect, which is that
on game day, things change really abruptly. At the very end of the
game, when you know if you've won or you've lost, you're much
happier or much sadder than you were at the beginning of the game.
So we expect to see really discrete jumps in sentiment
that we don't see from a model like this. And this
is because this is a bad model of the underlying data
generating process. So we need something more flexible. One way to
do that is just to use a seven day moving
average. Which is going to allow us to include only kind
of the last game sentiment in the moving average. So we're
going to pick a moving average, like I showed you before.
Let's smooth it out into over a whole seven day period. And when
we do that, we get something that actually tells a really nice story
about the season. And has all the kind of characteristics that I would
expect as a fan in having gone through this. Which is, the kind
of, the big bumps up on game days where you win, the big
bumps down on game days where you lose. And then, kind of, these
plateaus in between, which are these periods of stability when you don't have
any information about how your team is doing. We see that a week off
around Thanksgiving but then there's a big spike in
happiness because people are [UNKNOWN] Thanksgiving. This big low point
right after a loss that could have knocked them out
of the playoffs. And then a big kind of ascension
to their playoff game which they ended up losing
and the subsequent dip. This I think is a really
nice depiction of what happened and it took a little
bit of averaging to get the story to come out.
>> When you're looking at all this data, what sort
of things come up for you in terms of bias and
variance tradeoffs.
>> When you're computing just a simple moving average like this,
you're dealing with one of the most, it's just a really
flexible statistic. And so you're, not imposing any structure on the
data. You're letting the data kind of speak. When I use a
moving average here and I plotted standard errors that were kind
of rolling along with the data. They were gigantic. The mean
sentiment for the season is somewhere in the three range. And
the standard errors were over two or three. We can say very
precisely what's happening at any given point. But our variance
on that estimate is huge. So as we started to
add more lags, higher number of lags to the, moving
average. We end up with kind of smoother looking plots, that
have lower variance but but then are getting progressively more
bias. So as we go back further we are including
more data and were getting more bias. Because were including
data from parts that actually aren't applicable to that exact point.
But in exchange for that we get a lower variance plot,
one that doesn't move as wildly. When we combine that with
splines, we can end up fitting a model, that has kind
of the best of both worlds. Which has the smoothing, aspects of
the splines, with the discrete jumps, of what happens on game
day. And so this is a spline where we add it dummy
variables for post game periods. In this model, we end up
with kind of all the same thing. We get the big jumps
that we expect, so it jumps down on loses, jumps up
on game days where they win. And then also kind of the
smooth transitions in between. So it's kind of a nice story of
taking one style of model, which is a spine, which is just
too specific for the data generating process, and maybe not a good
fit. And in doing some exploratory data analysis where we see that
averaging over seven days tells a really nice story and gives us
the discreteness that we want. And then combining those two together into
kind of an aggregate of the two types of models. Where We're able
to better account for the fact that game days, are, are an important thing.
