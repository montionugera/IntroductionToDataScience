To create this plot, we're going to have much of the
same code as before. We'll pass tenure to our x variable,
and then we'll pass friendships initiated divided by tenure to
our y variable, and we'll subset our data frame so that
we only consider users who have a tenure of at
least one day. We'll color our line by year_joined.bucket and then
we'll plot the mean of the y variable across tenure. Taking
a closer look, it appears that users with more tenure typically
initiate less friendships.
