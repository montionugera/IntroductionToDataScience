For this programming exercise, you need to create a variable
called, year joined bucket. That bin together users depending on
which year they joined Facebook. So, for example, this would
be one bucket, this would be one bucket, this would be
a bucket, and then these users would be another bucket.
To do this, we just need to use the cut function
on the variable year joined. I just need to tell
Cut, on what years I should split my data. So I'm
going to split at 2004, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2014.
Running this code, I can see that I got a new variable inside of my data frame.
