The GG pairs function uses a different plot type for
different types of combinations of variables. Hence, we have histograms here
and we have scatter plots here. Many of these plots
aren't quite as nice as they would be if we fine-tuned
them for the particular variables. For example, for all the
counts of likes, we might want to work on a logarithmic scale.
But, GG Pairs doesn't do this for us. At the very
least, a scatter plot matrix can be a useful starting point
in many analyses.
