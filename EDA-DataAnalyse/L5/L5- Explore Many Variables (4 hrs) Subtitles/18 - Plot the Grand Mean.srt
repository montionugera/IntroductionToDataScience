Looking at this plot, we can see that our suspicion
is confirmed. Users with a longer tenure tend to have
higher friend counts, with the exception of our older users,
say, about 80 and up. To put these cohort specific
medians in perspective, we can change them to cohort specific
means. And then plot the grand mean down here as
well. The grand mean is the line we saw in
lesson four when we plotted average friend count across the ages.
Let's see if you can change the code for this
plot to plot the means instead of the medians for
each cohort. You'll also want to plot out the grand
mean as well, that we talked about in lesson four.
