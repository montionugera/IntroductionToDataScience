To add a smoother to this plot, we need to
change geom line to geom smooth. We also need to
get rid of this fun.y parameter and the stat parameter.
We'll still keep yearjoined.bucket assigned a color, so that way
we see this segment in our graph. And here I'm
using the defaults for geom smooth. So R will automatically
choose the appropriate statistical methods based on our data. All
of that additional information can be found in the output
down here. So here again, in this smooth version of the
graph, we still see that the friendships initiated declines as tenure increases.
