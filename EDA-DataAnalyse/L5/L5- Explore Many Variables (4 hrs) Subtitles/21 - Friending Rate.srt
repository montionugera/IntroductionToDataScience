Here we want a summary of the friend rate. So,
we can use the with command and subset the data
so we only consider users with tenure of at least
one day. Now we just want a summary of friend count
divided by tenure, which gives us the friends per day
since the user's been active. When we run the code,
we see that the median rate is about 0.22, and
the maximum rate is 417. Now, this is definitely an outlier,
considering our data, since the third quartile is only about 0.5.
