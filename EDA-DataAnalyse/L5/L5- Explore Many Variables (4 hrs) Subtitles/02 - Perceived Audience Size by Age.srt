My next question was, well, okay, so people aren't very good at guessing their audience sizes. But maybe, maybe people who are older, maybe they have a better sense, than teenagers, for example. So the next plot that we did was another scatter plot, but this time we added a third level, where we added color to represent the age of the survey respondent. And you can see again we have this horizontal stripes for people who are guessing that there are 50 or 100 people in their audience. But I don't see any pattern in the color. I think this is actually kind of a dead end. This is one example of kind of a failure. I can tell if younger people were more accurate then older people, there is too much over plotting. In this plot there are too many dots on top of each other and color really doesn't add much.
