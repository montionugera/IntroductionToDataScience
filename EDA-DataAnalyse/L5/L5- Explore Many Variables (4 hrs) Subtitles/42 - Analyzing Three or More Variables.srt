Congratulations. You've made it a long way and
you've reached the end of lesson five. I
want to end this lesson with another reflection. Take
a few moments and write down some of the
things you've learned in this lesson in the
text box that will appear. Once you've done
that, submit your answer and then hear from
Tim and Moira about what they thought was important.
