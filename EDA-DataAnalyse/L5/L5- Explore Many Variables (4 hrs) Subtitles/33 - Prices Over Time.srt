For this solution, I'm showing you the GG plot code to
create the scatter plot of price versus time. Now, I've added
geom jitter here. So, that way, my points will show up
a little bit transparent. And I'll color them with an orange
hue. Looking at the plot, we can that the modal or
the most common prices, seem to be increasing over time. We
also see some lower price points scattered about the graph. These
may be due to sales or, perhaps, buyers using coupons that
bring down the price of yogurt.
