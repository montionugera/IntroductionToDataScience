To create this new plot, we really just need to
switch out gender with our year_joined.bucket variable. This is the new
categorical variable that will take the place of color. Now, I'm
also using year_joined.bucket here so that way, I can exclude the
two people who have values of NA. I'll clean up
my code just a little bit, and then I'll run it
to create my plot. And now, here's the plot that examines
the relationship between friend_count and
age, split up by year_joined.bucket variable.
