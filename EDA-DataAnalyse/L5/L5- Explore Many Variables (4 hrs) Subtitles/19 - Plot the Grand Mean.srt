To plot the means and study the medians for each of the
cohorts, we just need to change our fun.y parameter. This needs to
be mean instead. Now, to get the grand mean, we just add
a geom line and then set the parameters. We'll have a stat
of summary. We'll set fun.y to equal the mean, and then we'll
set the line type equal to two. Here, I'm using two so
that way, I get a dash line so it stands out in
comparison to these others. Plotting the grand mean is a good reminder
that much of the data in the sample is about members of recent cohorts. This is
the type of more high level observation that
you want to make as you explore data.
